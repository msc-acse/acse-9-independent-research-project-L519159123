# Generative Adversarial Networks applied to multi-component seismic data

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/msc-acse/acse-9-independent-research-project-L519159123.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/msc-acse/acse-9-independent-research-project-L519159123)

We provide PyTorch implementations for paired seismic data domain translation problems.

The code is an extension of source code written by Jun-Yan Zhu and Taesung Park, and supported by Tongzhou Wang, which is available via github repository https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix. 

## Prerequisites

  - For pip users, please type the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
  - For Conda users, we provide a installation script `./scripts/conda_deps.sh`. Alternatively, you can create a new Conda environment using `conda env create -f environment.yml`.
  - For Docker users, we provide the pre-built Docker image and Dockerfile. Please refer to our [Docker](docs/docker.md) page.
  
### CycleGAN train/test
- Download a CycleGAN dataset (e.g. maps):
```bash
bash ./datasets/download_cyclegan_dataset.sh maps
```
- To view training results and loss plots, run `python -m visdom.server` and click the URL http://localhost:8097.
- Train a model:
```bash
#!./scripts/train_cyclegan.sh
python train.py --dataroot ./datasets/maps --name maps_cyclegan --model cycle_gan
```
To see more intermediate results, check out `./checkpoints/maps_cyclegan/web/index.html`.
- Test the model:
```bash
#!./scripts/test_cyclegan.sh
python test.py --dataroot ./datasets/maps --name maps_cyclegan --model cycle_gan
```
- The test results will be saved to a html file here: `./results/maps_cyclegan/latest_test/index.html`.

### pix2pix train/test
- Download a pix2pix dataset (e.g.facades):
```bash
bash ./datasets/download_pix2pix_dataset.sh facades
```
- Train a model:
```bash
#!./scripts/train_pix2pix.sh
python train.py --dataroot ./datasets/facades --name facades_pix2pix --model pix2pix --direction BtoA
```
- To view training results and loss plots, run `python -m visdom.server` and click the URL http://localhost:8097. To see more intermediate results, check out  `./checkpoints/facades_pix2pix/web/index.html`.

- Test the model (`bash ./scripts/test_pix2pix.sh`):
```bash
#!./scripts/test_pix2pix.sh
python test.py --dataroot ./datasets/facades --name facades_pix2pix --model pix2pix --direction BtoA
```
- The test results will be saved to a html file here: `./results/facades_pix2pix/test_latest/index.html`. You can find more scripts at `scripts` directory.
- To train and test pix2pix-based colorization models, please add `--model colorization` and `--dataset_mode colorization`. See our training [tips](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/blob/master/docs/tips.md#notes-on-colorization) for more details.

### Apply a pre-trained model (CycleGAN)
- You can download a pretrained model (e.g. horse2zebra) with the following script:
```bash
bash ./scripts/download_cyclegan_model.sh horse2zebra
```
- The pretrained model is saved at `./checkpoints/{name}_pretrained/latest_net_G.pth`. Check [here](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/blob/master/scripts/download_cyclegan_model.sh#L3) for all the available CycleGAN models.
- To test the model, you also need to download the  horse2zebra dataset:
```bash
bash ./datasets/download_cyclegan_dataset.sh horse2zebra
```

- Then generate the results using
```bash
python test.py --dataroot datasets/horse2zebra/testA --name horse2zebra_pretrained --model test --no_dropout
```
- The option `--model test` is used for generating results of CycleGAN only for one side. This option will automatically set `--dataset_mode single`, which only loads the images from one set. On the contrary, using `--model cycle_gan` requires loading and generating results in both directions, which is sometimes unnecessary. The results will be saved at `./results/`. Use `--results_dir {directory_path_to_save_result}` to specify the results directory.

- For your own experiments, you might want to specify `--netG`, `--norm`, `--no_dropout` to match the generator architecture of the trained model.

### Apply a pre-trained model (pix2pix)
Download a pre-trained model with `./scripts/download_pix2pix_model.sh`.

- Check [here](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/blob/master/scripts/download_pix2pix_model.sh#L3) for all the available pix2pix models. For example, if you would like to download label2photo model on the Facades dataset,
```bash
bash ./scripts/download_pix2pix_model.sh facades_label2photo
```
- Download the pix2pix facades datasets:
```bash
bash ./datasets/download_pix2pix_dataset.sh facades
```
- Then generate the results using
```bash
python test.py --dataroot ./datasets/facades/ --direction BtoA --model pix2pix --name facades_label2photo_pretrained
```
- Note that we specified `--direction BtoA` as Facades dataset's A to B direction is photos to labels.

- If you would like to apply a pre-trained model to a collection of input images (rather than image pairs), please use `--model test` option. See `./scripts/test_single.sh` for how to apply a model to Facade label maps (stored in the directory `facades/testB`).

- See a list of currently available models at `./scripts/download_pix2pix_model.sh`
